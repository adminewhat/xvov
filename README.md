/>　　小儿子的病情刚有起色，我这两天又病倒了，可能是机体里早潜伏有病毒，只是没有发病，那天练完瑜珈回来后就感觉浑身疼痛、头痛、头晕，处于极度难受状态。在生病的这两天里，虽然自己感觉身体很难受，但为了小儿的一些事情还得支撑身体打理，因为放心不下，正是应了一句话：可怜天下父母心。　　生病在家里，脑子里诸多思绪，突然想起周国平先生在一篇文章里说过的话，大意是：习惯失去是我们每个人必备的心理素质，一生中我们要失去很多，乃至最后失去我们宝贵的生命。这又让我想起了另一本“神秘的生命灵光”，该书列举了大量的例证，说明有过濒死经历的人都感觉到自己的灵魂浮于身体的上方，能看到光和长长黑色的管道，最后还是看到天使和已失去的亲朋，感觉很温暖，一点也不痛苦，听到的是仙乐，看到的是奇花异草。说明死亡对于人类并不可怕，或许生命之后还有生命？虽然只是学术论点，但书中强调，近年来西方越来越多的人在研究它。有过濒死经历的人最后返世，都表现的与前之不同，充满了爱心和欲望，所以说生命的世界和大自然是非常的奇妙。　　我精神状态不佳时，也会想起死这个问题，感觉如果人活的很累，长眠未必不是最好的休息方式，虽然颓废了点，但总感觉自己有时面临许多的难题无法解决，例如，现阶段孩子的教育问题是我的烦恼之最，有时想，如果不要孩子就不会有这么多的烦脑，但朋友们说，那你就不是一个完整的女人，为了做一个完整的女人，我饱尝了养育孩子之苦，现在的儿子是第二胎，是整个孕期保胎而得，比平常孕妇受的苦不能同日而语，当时只有一个信念就是把他生下来，但抚育之艰难只有我们夫妻所知。或许应该尊循大自然的规律，存在不住的就应该淘汰。　　习惯失去，对于成年人来说，真的是一个处处要自己来调节的一个心态，在现今竟争激烈、人才辈出的时代，你就只是一粒沙，微不足道，你的喜、怒、哀、乐引不起人们的关注，只有自己把自己要当回事，尽量开心吧！
